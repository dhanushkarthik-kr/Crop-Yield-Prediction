# Crop Yield Prediction
This project tackles the prediction of crop yield, fertilizer requirements, and market prices using various environmental and soil factors.

Features:
Crop Yield Prediction: Estimate the potential yield for a specific crop based on parameters like temperature, humidity, soil fertility, and historical data.
Fertilizer Recommendation: Receive suggestions on fertilizer types and quantities based on predicted yield and soil analysis.
Market Price Prediction: Gain insights into potential market prices for various crops to help with informed planting decisions.

This project empowers farmers with a comprehensive suite of prediction tools.  By leveraging various environmental and soil factors like temperature, humidity, and soil fertility, the application estimates potential crop yield, recommends fertilizer types and quantities, and even provides insights into market prices for various crops. This information empowers data-driven decision making, allowing farmers to optimize planting choices, resource allocation, and potential profits. The user-friendly interface, built with Streamlit, makes interacting with the application and visualizing results a breeze.
